Ok now I need an about me article. 

Hi. I'm Daniel. I'm from Poland. I love hiking in the mountains. Since childhood I was captivated by the sense of wander and freedom coming from books like "Lord of the Rings" and video games such as "The Elder Scrolls" series. 

I would loose myself in those fantastical worlds on countless adventures. In my adult life I discovered that grander adventures can be had out there in the real world. 

In September 2021 I have dropped a bomb on my happy normal life and became a lone digital nomad. So far I have visited Greece, Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, England, France, Italy, Switzerland, Netherlands, Turkey, Germany, Slovakia, Vietnam, Thailand and Spain. I have met many incredible people, forged amazing friendships and created memories that will last me a lifetime.

I'm not much of a cyclist but despite that fact I have decided to embark on this journey. 

People often ask me why. I have dificulty explaining my insanity. 

I feel that the quote from the "Pale Blue Dot" by Carl Sagan explains it best:

"In the last 10.000 years; an instant in our long history we've abandoned the wandering life. We domesticated the plants and animals. Why chase the food when it can come to you? For all it's material advantages, the sedentary life has left us edgy and unfulfilled. Even after 400 generations in villages and cities we have not forgotten. The open road still softly calls, like a nearly forgotten song of childhood. We invest the far off places with a certain romance. The appeal I suspect has been meticulously crafted by natural selection as an essential element of our survival. Long summers, mild winters, plentiful gain. None of that lasts forever."

I explained to myself that maybe if I complete this journey that internal craving will subside. So far it has only grown stronger.

People I meet as this homeless dirty traveller show me great kindness a lot of interest and support. When I ask myself why, despite the language barrier I can see the answer in their eyes. Somewhere deep down they also have this craving. They also hear the call of the open road. It is so easy to find similarities and connection with people of all nations.

For all you nationalists out there, hear my point of view!

"Why should I limit my pride to being a member of the nation that gave birth to Nicolaus Copernicus when I can proudly embrace my membership in a species with countless inspiring heroes, scientists, and philosophers? Why not take pride in being a part of a species capable of love?"
